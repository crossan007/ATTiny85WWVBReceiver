# Hypothesis
The purpose of the VCO (voltage controlled oscialltor) in the costas loop is to recover the carrier wave used to to modulate the data wave.

As I understand it, you "receive" the modulated wave on the antenna, and then T it into two different signal paths.

Each of the two signal paths are mixed with a "faux-carrier" (generated by the VCO); however one of the paths is mixed with an inverted "faux-carrier".

After mixing the faux-carrier with the signals, the results of the mixing are "summed"; and in BPSK-modulated signals, the sum of the mixed signals should equal a logical "1";  if the value is less than one, the VCO adjusts the phase of the faux-carrier until the sum of the two mixed signals is "1".

Once the carrier has been reconstructed (having a mixed signal value of "1"), then the result of mixing the non-inverted faux-carrier (which is now actually aligned with the transmitter's carrier)  with the received signal, is actually the demodulated BPSK baseband signal.

So, my hypothesis here is that I can use the ATTiny85 to re-construct the original carrier wave, and recover the baseband signal of the BPSK-modulated broadband signal.
And, additionally, use the ATTiny85 to interpret/decode the baseband binary signal from the atomic clock WWVB , and render "timestamps" to I2C

# Idea:
1) ATTiny85 PWM to implement the VCO portion of the Costas loop on PWM
2) ATTiny85 to parse demodulated BPSK time signals and output over I2C
3) Hardware implementation of Low Pass filter portion of Costas Loop
